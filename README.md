### Advantages
- Reliable access to data
- Client-side encryption so data between a client & a server is always encrypted and the server stores sensitive data in encrypted format
- Multi-factor authentication (Account password, One Time Passwords, Master Password, Hardware Security Key
- Access policy establishes access rights for each user or for a team
- Secure sharing and access to shared data
- Hybrid cryptography which combines the convenience of a public-key cryptography (RSA 4096-bit) with the efficiency of a symmetric-key (AES-256) cryptography and does not require the sender and receiver to share a common secret in order to communicate securely
